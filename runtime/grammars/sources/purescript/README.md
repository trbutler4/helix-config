# tree-sitter-purescript
This is a quick-and-dirty fork of [tree-sitter-haskell](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-haskell) with better compliance to the [Purescript](https://github.com/purescript/purescript) language grammar. It might choke on edge-cases, but provides better syntax highlighting in editors.
