# tree-sitter-go-mod

[tree-sitter][] grammar for go.mod files.

[tree-sitter]: https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter

## Status

The grammar is fairly small, and has been working well for highlighting for me. 
I expect it to evolve slightly to better fit tree-sitter best practices, but there shouldn't
be anything major. I'll release a 1.0 version in a couple of months once I'm confident it's
stable. In the mean time, if you run into an issue, please file a report!
