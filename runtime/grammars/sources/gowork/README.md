# tree-sitter-go-work

[tree-sitter][] grammar for `go.work` files.

[tree-sitter]: https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter

Based on [tree-sitter-go-mod](https://github.com/camdencheek/tree-sitter-go-mod) but for `go.work` files
rather than `go.mod` files (see [proposal](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/45713))
