## Use Information

tree-sitter-clojure has been used in the following:

* One of the supported languages in the [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter#supported-languages) plugin for
[neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) where [tree-sitter support is still in the early stages](https://neovim.io/news/2021/07).

* One of the supported languages in [difftastic](https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic) -- "an experimental diff tool that compares files based on their syntax".

* One of the supported languages in [Cursorless](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless) -- "a spoken language for structural code editing, enabling developers to code by voice at speeds not possible with a keyboard".

* Exploring [alternative highlighting ideas](https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-tree-sitter/issues/68) and [an early emacs user foray](https://ag91.github.io/blog/2021/06/22/how-(simple-is)-to-install-a-clojure-tree-sitter-grammar-and-use-it-from-emacs/), both via [emacs-tree-sitter](https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-tree-sitter).

* Base of [tree-sitter-commonlisp](https://github.com/theHamsta/tree-sitter-commonlisp)

* Older versions of the grammar were used to implement [Atom support](https://github.com/sogaiu/language-clojure/tree/tree-sitter-clojure) as well as a couple of [proof-of-concept](https://github.com/sogaiu/vscode-clojure-defs)
[VSCode extensions](https://github.com/sogaiu/vscode-clojure-colorizer).  However, these have not been updated to use the most recent grammar.
