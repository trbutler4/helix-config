# tree-sitter-opencl
OpenCL C grammar for Treesitter.

Adapted from [tree-sitter-c](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c).

This is currently just the above C grammar with the addition of the OpenCL C keywords and types; I haven't attempted full coverage of the OpenCL C spec. Feel free to create an issue or pull request if you experience problems.
