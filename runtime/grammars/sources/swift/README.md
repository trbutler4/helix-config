# tree-sitter-swift

This contains the generated [`tree-sitter`](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter) grammar files for the Swift
programming language. See [the `main` branch](https://github.com/alex-pinkus/tree-sitter-swift/tree/main) for the
repository branch that is used for development.

## Getting started

Using `main` is preferred over using this branch. If you cannot generate a grammar file yourself, and you must fetch
your grammar from a Git repository, this branch will come in handy.
